# Minegram
Minegram is a dead simple Minecraft-Telegram bridge.
  
# How to use
Grab the binary from https://github.com/uditkarode/Minegram/releases. Place it in the same folder as your Minecraft server JAR,  
and also create a config file in the same directory. Sample contents of the config file are given in the config file in this repository.
Then just execute the binary: `./minegram` and you're set!
  
IMPORTANT: make sure that bot privacy is turned **off** using BotFather so that non-command messages can be read by the bot!
